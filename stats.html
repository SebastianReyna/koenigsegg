        <h2>koenigsegg jesko stats</h2>
        
        
        <p>The Koenigsegg Jesko is the company’s latest supercar, third megacar, and spiritual successor to the iconic Agera. Unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show, the Jesko boasts a power-to-weight ratio greater than 1:1, which means its engine generates more horsepower than the car’s total curb weight in kilograms. Koenigsegg offered similar versions of the One:1 and Agera, but the Jesko takes things one step further with an impressive downforce rating of 2,205 pounds.

Named after Jesko von Koenigsegg, the father of company founder and CEO, Christian von Koenigsegg, the Jesko marks the debut of the firm’s latest carbon-fiber chassis and nine-speed multi-clutch transmission. It’s also supposed to hit at least 300 mph according to Koenigsegg, so it could improve the Agera RS’ 277-mph world record really soon. Let’s find out more about that in the review below.</p>
